## About BNK48
![](https://github.com/tigerstat46/BNK48/blob/master/BNK48.jpg)
BNK48 is sister idol group of AKB48. BNK stands for Bangkok(I think everyone knows it). In 2017, they debuted the first single "Aitakatta" but this single not popular. After they released "Koisuru Fortune Cookie" song, BNK48 rating is sharply high because KFC is Earworm song like PPAP(Pen Pie Apple Pen) : Piko Taro and เต่างอย : จินตหรา พูนลาภ.<br>
